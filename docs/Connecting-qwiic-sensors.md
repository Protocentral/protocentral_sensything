# **Why Qwiic?**

<p align="center">   <img width="550" height="350" src="images/Qwiic image.JPG"> </p>

[Qwiic functionality](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) was first devised by Sparkfun. If you ask why Qwiic? It makes prototyping easy and less complex.With Sensything we have built-in support for popular Qwiic sensors. With a list of sensors and connectors in the Qwiic section, you can use multiple sensors at the same time using the [Daisy chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)) method. With two Qwiic slots provided on the board, you can keep going.

## Using Qwiic connect system with Sensything

The Qwiic connect option with Sensything makes sensor plug ins a whole lot easier. With the board in hand, we would be able to pre-program for a list of Qwiic sensor. This would make it more suitable to plug in, detect the sensor and the load the code automatically. We will be updating this section.
