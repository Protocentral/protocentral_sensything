A sensor is a measure of the changes that occur in the physical environment or it is your chance to interface with the physical world. It collects this data and provides an analog voltage as an output. The output range usually varies from 0 to 5 volts, for most of them.

In case of Sensything, the type of sensors to be used are:-

**Analog**

An Analog sensor has the ability to measure the variable in a continuous manner and by detecting the proportional value. In other words Analog is directly related to precision. To enhance this capability the Sensything has an inbuilt 24-bit ADC called ADS1220 for quick and precision based sensor readings. In case your projects are reliant on accurate and precision values for your varied proects then look no further.

**Qwiic**

[Qwiic functionality](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) was first devised by Sparkfun. If you ask why Qwiic? It makes prototyping easy and less complex.With Sensything we have built-in support for popular Qwiic sensors. With a list of sensors and connectors in the Qwiic section, you can use multiple sensors at the same time using the [Daisy chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering) method. With two Qwiic slots provided on the board, you can keep going.
