**Qwiic**

[Qwiic functionality](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) was first devised by Sparkfun. If you ask why Qwiic? It makes prototyping easy and less complex.With Sensything we have built-in support for popular Qwiic sensors. With a list of sensors and connectors in the Qwiic section, you can use multiple sensors at the same time using the [Daisy chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)) method. With two Qwiic slots provided on the board, you can keep going.

You can find Qwiic sensor experiments in
