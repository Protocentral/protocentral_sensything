This is an example of how to use libesphttpd with the Espressif FreeRTOS SDK.


# ESP32

Ensure that you have updated submodules appropriately:

```git submodule update --init --recursive```

Run the esp32 makefile (make sure you enable the esphttpd component) and build

```make```

Load onto your esp32 and monitor

```make flash&&make monitor```

# ESP8266

Building for ESP8266 requires a bit more work.

Ensure that you are defining SDK_PATH to point at the ESP8266_RTOS_SDK:

```export SDK_PATH=/some/path/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK```

Update your path to point at your xtensa-lx106 tool chain, something like:

```export PATH=/some/path/esp-open-sdk/xtensa-lx106-elf/bin:$PATH```

If you don't have these tools you can get the SDK from:
https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK

And you can get the crosstool source (you'll have to build the toolchain yourself) from :
https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk

And then you should be able to build with:

```make -f Makefile.esp8266 USE_OPENSDK=yes FREERTOS=yes -C libesphttpd```

# Old notes

(I'm not sure these still apply, I mostly build for ESP32, feedback and pull requests welcome in this area)

The Makefile in this example isn't perfect yet: something is going wrong with the dependency
checking, causing files that have changed not always being recompiled. To work around this,
please run a
```make clean && make -C libesphttpd && make```
before running
```make flash```
